Question:
Implementation of Queue, DEQUEUE and Circular queue using arrays  

Solution:
*What is Queue?
Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.

Refer to the program!

Input and Output
----------------

Inserted -> 1
  Inserted -> 2

  Queue is full!! 
 
  Front -> 0 
  Items -> 1 2 3 4 5 
  Rear -> 4 
 
  Deleted element -> 1 
 
  Front -> 1 
  Items -> 2 3 4 5 
  Rear -> 4 
 
  Inserted -> 7
