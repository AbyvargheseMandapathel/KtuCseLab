Question:
Implementation of Merge sort

Solution:
How it's done?
Merge sort runs in O (n log n) running time. It is very efficient sorting algorithm with near optimal number of comparison. Recursive algorithm used for merge sort comes under the category of divide and conquer technique. An array of n elements is split around its center producing two smaller arrays. After these two arrays are sorted independently, they can be merged to produce the final sorted array. The process of splitting and merging can be carried recursively till there is only one element in the array. An array with 1 element is always sorted
Refer to the program!


Input and Output
----------------
Enter the no of elements: 5
Enter array elements:34 6 12 0 22

Sorted array is: 0 6 12 22 34
